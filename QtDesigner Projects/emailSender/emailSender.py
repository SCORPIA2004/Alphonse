            Hello there,ðŸ‘‹
            <br>I am a <strong>Computer Engineering student at Bilkent University</strong> and would like to explore summer internship opportunities at your company, specifically to join your <strong>frontend or software dev teams</strong>. Apart from the rigorous curriculum at Bilkent, I have also taken additional courses and have gained several skills, such as frontend development and game development (using Unity and C#). In my frontend courses, I have learnt how to use HTML5, CSS and Javascript to make interactive websites that users will engage with. You can find an example of one I made <a href = "https://scorpia2004.github.io/Brainnest-Frontend/Assignment%202%20-%20CSS/index.html">here</a>. 
            <br><br>Moreover, I have been learning <strong>React.js</strong> since last summer for building web applications and also REST with Spring for the backend. Here's a frontend web app Restaurant Menu I made using React.js: <a href = "https://github.com/SCORPIA2004/Urokodaki">link</a>. In my Unity courses, I have learnt how to make 3D games using C# and the Unity Game development engine. You can check out the 3D Martian racer game ðŸŽ® I made a while back when learning Unity (I took inspiration from a similar game I used to play as a kid). It is published on <a href = "https://scorpia2004.itch.io">itch.io</a>.
            <br>I also have strong foundations in C++, Java and OOP, thanks to CS102 and CS201 courses at Bilkent. You can check out the CS102 project I made using Java and the Vaadin Framework <a href = "https://github.com/SCORPIA2004/CS-102-Project-ATLA-g1I">here</a>.
            <br><br>Above all, I would like to work and gain further experience by working on real-life projects with your frontend or software dev teams. I have attached my resume for you to look over, and here is the link to my <a href = "https://github.com/SCORPIA2004">GitHub</a> so you can check out more of my personal projects. I would love the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to your teams.
            <br><br>I hope to hear from you soon.ðŸ™Œ
            <br><br>P.S. I also write as a hobby; you can check it out at <a href = "https://medium.com/@mshayanalwaha">Medium</a>, and here is my <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammed-shayan-usman/">LinkedIn</a>.
            <br><br>Thank you,
